This section of the documentation covers the reference material for
`census21api`. According to the DiÃ¡taxis framework, reference guides are:

> technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference
> material is information-oriented.

Right now, the only reference material we need our API reference, which
contains the technical details of the core `CensusAPI` class and its methods.

We automatically generate this reference material using
[`quartodoc`](https://machow.github.io/quartodoc/get-started/overview.html).
