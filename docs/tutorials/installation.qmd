    Instructions for the various ways you can install the `census21api` package
---

Currently, the `census21api` package is only installable through GitHub. We
also require Python 3.8 or higher.

## Installing from GitHub via `pip`

To install from GitHub via `pip`, use the following command:

```bash
$ python -m pip install census21api@git+https://github.com/datasciencecampus/census21api
```

## Installing from source

If you would prefer to install directly from source, use the following
commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/datasciencecampus/census21api.git
$ cd census21api
$ python -m pip install .
```

## Installing to contribute

If you intend on doing any sort of development on `census21api` - like writing documentation or implementing a new feature - it is highly recommended to
install from source _as editable_ and _with the development dependencies_.

To do so, make a fork of the repository and then run the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/census21api.git
$ cd census21api
$ python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
